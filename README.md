# Button-changes-color
This is a simple document using java script to change the color of a webpage.  
There are two files, which were two separate attempts.  
In my first attempt, the button would change the color once from orange to blue.  
You can see the code is very simple and basic.
In the second attempt, I added an "if else" statement into the function.  
I also used a boolean to maintain the state of the button.   
In the second one you can change the color back and forth repeatedly with the button.
